 A fast explicit nearly symplectic precise integration algorithm for solving wave equations in the time domain

1、system with one degree of freedom

​      By setting “dt” time step, the calculation results and pictures in the paper are obtained.

2、one dimension

​    Run the, figure4.m file in the folder ' figure4 ' to get the picture in the paper.

3、two  dimension

​     Run the  figure13_a.m file in the folder to get the picture in the paper.

​     Run the  figure13_b.m file in the folder to get the picture in the paper.

​      Run the lay2_pim_matrix_Figure_12.m file in the folder to get the picture in the paper.

​     Run the  figure11_a.m file in the folder to get the picture in the paper.

​     Run the  figure11_b.m file in the folder to get the picture in the paper.
